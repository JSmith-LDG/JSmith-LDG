about_me_description: I have a passion for games, I got my start in game dev back in 2015 when I created and published my first game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ldg.proton&hl=en_US&gl=US">Proton Blaster</a> on the Google play store. Since then I went on to develop my skills and further my understanding of the development process. In 2018 I got contracted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/drakelinglabs/">Drakeling Labs</a> to work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/581910/Iron_Armada/">Iron Armada</a> as a community dev and quickly worked my way up to lead programmer. In October 2020 I was given the opportunity to work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203650/Blood_Metal/">Blood Metal</a> as the lead programmer and in September was promoted to project manager.
