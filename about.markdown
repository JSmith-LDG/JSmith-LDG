Indie Game Dev 

I have a passion for games, I got my start in game dev back in 2015 when I created and published my first game Proton Blaster on the Google play store. Since then I went on to develop my skills and further my understanding of the development process. In 2018 I got contracted by Drakeling Labs to work on Iron Armada as a community dev and quickly worked my way up to lead programmer. In October 2020 I was given the opportunity to work on Blood Metal as the lead programmer and in September was promoted to project manager.
